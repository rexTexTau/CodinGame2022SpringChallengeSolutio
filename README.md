# CodinGame 2022 Spring Challenge Solutio

My humble version of C# Codingame Spring Challenge 2022 Solution. 

## Points of interest

This solution implements weighted decision-making system: any possible character's game action in a specific moment of time 



## Platform inconvenience

...

## Actual results

Not so high. My bot (not AI, just pre-AI stub) reached 4166th place of 7695, ending the competition in Silver league (1,646th of 2,113 league members).

Nevertheless, it was a great, entertaining and challenging experience.

## Disclaimer

Code published as-is, without any polish after end of the event. Since it's the code from a time-limited challenge, there could be places where it's a little bit dirty, there's no comments or even some errors. Please accept these facts understandingly.
